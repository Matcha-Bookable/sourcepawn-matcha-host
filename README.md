# Matcha Host (SourcePawn)
This plugin is used to grant the first users host privilege using `!host` by allowing them to perform simple server operations such as kick and bans. They will be able to transfer their host status to another player via the host menu.

> Non-persistent, this plugin will not work after server restarts or plugin reload

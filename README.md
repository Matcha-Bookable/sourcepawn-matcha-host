# Matcha Host (SourcePawn)
This plugin is used to grant the first users host privilege using `!host` by allowing them to perform simple server operations. This is being used across Matcha Bookable's servers and will serve as a replacement for [Matcha-Bookable/sourcepawn-custom-votemenu](https://github.com/Matcha-Bookable/sourcepawn-custom-votemenu) and soon terminate the need for server admins.

> Bans are non-persistent, the banlist will not persist after server restarts or plugin reload
